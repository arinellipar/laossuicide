# Missing Dependencies Fix

## Problem
The application was throwing "cannot find module" errors when trying to run the development server, specifically for the `immer` package.

## Root Cause
The Zustand cart store (`src/stores/cartStore.ts`) was importing the immer middleware:

```typescript
import { immer } from "zustand/middleware/immer";
```

However, while Zustand provides the immer middleware wrapper, it requires the actual `immer` package to be installed separately as a dependency.

## Solution
Installed the missing dependencies:

```bash
# Primary missing package
npm install immer --legacy-peer-deps

# Verified other dependencies (already installed)
npm install clsx --legacy-peer-deps  # Was already up to date
```

**Note**: Used `--legacy-peer-deps` due to existing Prisma/Lucia version conflicts in the project.

### Dependencies Verified
- ✅ **immer** - Required for Zustand immer middleware
- ✅ **clsx** - Used in utils.ts for conditional CSS classes  
- ✅ **zustand** - State management library
- ✅ **framer-motion** - Animation library
- ✅ **lucide-react** - Icon library
- ✅ **zod** - Schema validation
- ✅ **decimal.js** - Decimal arithmetic
- ✅ **canvas-confetti** - Confetti animations

## Why Immer is Needed
Immer is used in the cart store for:
- **Immutable State Updates**: Allows writing "mutative" logic that produces immutable updates
- **Simplified State Management**: Makes complex nested state updates more readable
- **Performance**: Optimizes re-renders by ensuring proper immutability

## Code Using Immer
In `src/stores/cartStore.ts`:

```typescript
export const useCartStore = create<CartState>()(
  devtools(
    subscribeWithSelector(
      persist(
        immer((set, get) => ({
          // State mutations that look mutable but are actually immutable
          addItem: (product: Product, quantity: number = 1) => {
            set((state) => {
              // Direct "mutations" to state - Immer handles immutability
              state.items.set(product.id, cartItem);
              state.totalItems = Array.from(items.values()).reduce(...);
              state.error = null;
            });
          },
          // ... other actions
        }))
      )
    )
  )
);
```

## Result
✅ **Development server starts successfully**  
✅ **No more module dependency errors**  
✅ **Cart store functions properly**  
✅ **Immutable state updates working**  
✅ **All external package imports resolved**  

## Dependencies Status
After installation and verification:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "immer": "^10.1.1",     // ✅ Added - Required for Zustand immer middleware
    "clsx": "^2.1.0",       // ✅ Verified - Already installed
    "zustand": "^4.5.2",    // ✅ Already installed
    "framer-motion": "^12.19.2", // ✅ Already installed
    "lucide-react": "^0.525.0",  // ✅ Already installed
    "zod": "^3.23.8",       // ✅ Already installed
    "decimal.js": "^10.6.0", // ✅ Already installed
    "canvas-confetti": "^1.9.3" // ✅ Already installed
  }
}
```

The application now runs without module errors and all functionality should work as expected.
